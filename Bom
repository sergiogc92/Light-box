To make the project we use:

    1 Arduino Leonardo.

    1 Strip board.

    1 Microphone.

    1 Terminal block.

    24 White leds.

    Some RGB LED stipt light. 

    Wires.
    2Hinges.
    Some wood.

If you need to amplify the output signal from the microphone:

    1 2N2222A transistor.

    2 110nF Capacitors.

    2 10k Resistors.

    1 100k Potentiometer.

If you need to use a voltage regulator:

    1 7805 Voltage regulator.

    1 330nF Capacitor.

    1 110nF Capacitor.
